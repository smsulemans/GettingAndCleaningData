This file contain instructions for running exploratory data analysis project 1

there are 4 scripts
1) First Histogram (produces plot1.png 480x480 pixels)
2) Second Graph (produces plot2.png 480x480 pixels)
3) Third Graph (produces plot3.png 480x480 pixels)
4) Fourth Graph (produces plot4.png 480x480 pixels)

for code to work "household_power_consumption.txt" should be in your working directory
