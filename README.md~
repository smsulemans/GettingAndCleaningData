This file contain instructions for running run_Analysis.R script.

run_Analysis.R script is developed as a project requirement for Getting and Cleaning data course.

Open run_Analysis.R file in RGui using File->Open Script...
Run Script by Edit->Run all

Make sure that you have "UCI HAR Dataset" extracted in current working directory

For checking current working director run getwd() in R console

e.g. in my windows 7 pc getwd() shows following output

> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/HP/Documents"

and my extracted data is in 

C:/Users/HP/Documents/UCI HAR Dataset/ directory
C:/Users/HP/Documents/UCI HAR Dataset/test directory
C:/Users/HP/Documents/UCI HAR Dataset/train directory

In R Console you will see the script running.

After successfully finishing script will produce TinyData.txt in C:/Users/HP/Documents/UCI HAR Dataset/ directory

One R package is required for this script "dplyr", for group_by function call. I have included command to install that package when needed

install.packages("dplyr")

if this package is already installed on your system, you can comment this line by putting a # in the start of this line

for any error you can communicate with me (if coursera rules permit us, I donot have enough information) on address ssulemans@gmail.com

many thanks
